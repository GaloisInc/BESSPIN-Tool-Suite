# Building Firesim Binaries on an F1 Instance #

This document details the process of building important Firesim binaries used
by `besspin.py` to run on AWS PV-FireSim.
The binaries are stored in the BESSPIN-LFS repository.
A short description of each binary follows.

* `nbd.ko` - Network block device kernel driver.  Used for mounting qcow2
  images
* `xdma.ko` - Xilinx PCIE DMA driver
* `libdwarf.so.1.0.0` - Library to consume and produce DWARF debug information
* `libelf-0.175.so` - Library to read and write ELF files
* `FireSim-f1` - Controls simulation and communicates with the FPGA
* `switch0` - Facilitates internet communication with simulated node

## Install Build Dependencies ##

Use the following `yum` command to install the necessary build dependencies:

```bash
sudo yum install -y autoconf automake gcc zlib-devel flex bison make sudo wget rpm-build net-tools bc openssl python-devel java-devel gettext ncurses-devel dtc glib2-devel pixman-devel python3-pip python3-devel gmp-devel
```

## Mount Additional Storage ##

The root partition on an f1.2xlarge does not have enough free space to build
the Firesim binaries, so you'll need to format and mount the provided SSD:

```bash
sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/nvme0n1
sudo mkdir /data
sudo mount /dev/nvme0n1 /data
sudo chown centos /data
```

## Prepare Firesim Repository ##

Clone the firesim repo, and run the included setup script to pull down all
submodules.

```bash
cd /data
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/firesim/firesim.git
cd firesim
./build-setup.sh --submodules-only
```

The build scripts expect a newer version of `git` than exists on the f1, so
you'll need to remove the `--depth 1` argument to `git submodule` in
`target-design/chipyard/scripts/build-toolchains.sh`.
You can do this with sed:

```bash
sed -i 's/--depth 1//g' target-design/chipyard/scripts/build-toolchains.sh
```

Now you can finish the build setup process with:

```bash
./build-setup.sh --fast
```

This script takes a while to run.
It sets various environmental variables you'll need to build `FireSim-f1` and
`switch0`, and builds the shared object files and kernel modules we require.
Relative to the root of the firesim repo, the outputs will be located:

* `build/nbd.ko`
* `platforms/f1/aws-fpga/sdk/linux_kernel_drivers/xdma/xdma.ko`
* `target-design/chipyard/riscv-tools-install/lib/libdwarf.so.1.0.0`
* `target-design/chipyard/riscv-tools-install/lib/libelf-0.175.so`

## Important Environmental Variables ##

Before you can build `FireSim-f1`, you must understand the following
environmental variables that will specialize the binary to a specific target
and platform:

* `TARGET_CONFIG`: Specifies a `Config` instance that is consumed by the target
  design's generator.  Example target configurations and details on how to
  create your own target configurations are available in
  `docs/Advanced-Usage/Generating-Different-Targets.rst`.
  Additionally, grepping for "extends Config" will help you find more
  predefined target configurations.
* `PLATFORM_CONFIG`: Specifies a `Config` instance that is consumed by Golden
  Gate and specified compiler-level and host-land parameters, such as whether
  to enable assertion synthesis, or multi-ported RAM optimizations.  You can
  find common platform configurations in
  `sim/firesim-lib/src/main/scala/configs/CompilerConfigs.scala`.

## Building FireSim-f1 ##

Before building `FireSim-f1`, you must source `sourceme-f1-manager.sh`.
Part of that script sets up ssh to manage child FireSim instances.
Since we don't care about that, you should remove that portion of the script
before sourcing it.

```bash
echo "" > deploy/ssh-setup.sh
source sourceme-f1-manager.sh
```

Now you can build `FireSim-f1`:

```bash
cd sim
make TARGET_CONFIG=<desired target> PLATFORM_CONFIG=<desired platform> xsim
```

Relative to the root of the firesim repo, the output binary will be at
`sim/generated-src/f1/FireSim-FireSimRocketConfig-BaseF1Config/FireSim-f1`

## Building switch0 ##

Before you can build `switch0`, you'll need to create
`target-design/switch/switchconfig.h` with the parameters you would like the
switch to have.
Use the following template to create this file:

```C++
// Clients config
#ifdef NUMCLIENTSCONFIG
#define NUMPORTS 0  // Replace with the number of ports you want
#define NUMDOWNLINKS 0  // Replace with the number of downlinks you want
#define NUMUPLINKS 0  // Replace with the number of uplinks you want
#endif  // NUMCLIENTSCONFIG

#ifdef PORTSETUPCONFIG
// Define each uplink and downlink
// ports[<index>] = ShmemPort OR SocketServerPort
#endif // PORTSETUPCONFIG

// MAC to port mapping
#ifdef MACPORTSCONFIG
uint16_t mac2port[/* size */] { /* elements */ };
#endif
```

Once `switchconfig.h` is in place, you can build `switch0`:

```bash
cd target-design/switch
make
mv switch switch0
```

The FireSim build scripts always build `switch` then move it to `switch<N>`, so
this document does the same for completeness.

## A Note on Exact Binary Reproducibility ##

This build process may produce binaries that are not identical even when using
the same compiler and configuration environmental variables.
For example, the build injects the build path into the binary.
Therefore, building from different locations will produce binaries that are not
bitwise identical.
There may be other factors that produce binaries that are not bitwise
identical.
However, the binaries produced by controlling for the variables in this
document should be functionally equivalent.
