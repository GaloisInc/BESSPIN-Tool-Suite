# PoC-Exploits

Proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits for some of the SSITH vulnerability classes.

----------

This directory contains in-depth explanations of examples that provide 
codes to demonstrate
one or more weaknesses.  Weaknesses are related to exactly one, or a
collection of, CWEs.

These PoCs are merely proof-of-concepts that we use to illustrate the
concept of vulnerabilities and weaknesses. For the security evaluation
platform, please refer to 
[../README.md](../README.md).

## List of the Existing PoC Codes

1. [Heartbleed](./Heartbleed) [Buffer Errors]: A flaw in the heartbeat
   protocol that allows an attacker to access up to 64KB of the memory
   because of out-of-boundary memcpy.

2. [Padding Leakage](./PaddingLeakage) [Information Leakage]: Accessing
   non-authorized bytes in memory due to struct alignment and padding.

3. [Dictionary Attack](./DictionaryAttack) [Permission, Privileges, and Access
   Control]: Attempting to defeat an authentication mechanism by
   systematically entering each word in a dictionary as a password.

4. [Skein Hash Function](./SkeinHashFunction) [Numeric Errors]: A cryptographic hash
   function that can return undefined results if called with incorrect
   initializing parameters, owing to a numeric overflow in its
   finalization algorithm.
