# Further Constraining Buffer Errors Tests #

This document details how to to constrain the buffer errors test suite
to generate tests that stress a more narrow class of errors than the default
test suite.

## Buffer Errors Clafer ##

The buffer errors tool uses a clafer model to define a set of program
constraints and specifies a mapping from CWEs to constraints.  You may force
the setting of of specific constraints by providing your own custom error
model.  To do so, create a copy of the builtin model
(`fett/cwesEvaluation/bufferErrors/bufferErrors.cfr`) and list the constraints
you would like to set at the end of the `BufferErrors_Test` section.  Do not
directly edit the builtin model definition.

For example, if you'd like to only generate stack tests, rather than a mix of
stack and heap tests, you should add `[Location_Stack]` to the end of your
clafer file (indented by two spaces to apply it to the `BufferErrors_Test`
section).  You may add as many constraints as you'd like, and the tool will
take their conjunction.  You should not remove any definitions from this file.

To use your custom model, make the following changes to the `bufferErrors
section of `config.ini`:
* Set `useCustomErrorModel` to `Yes`
* Set `pathToCustomErrorModel` to point to your custom error model file

## Constraining Numeric Types ##

By default, the tool will generate tests that stress a variety of integer and
floating point tests.  You may restrict it to generate only integer or floating
point tests by modifying the `numericTypes` option in the `bufferErrors`
section of `config.ini`.

## Example ##

Say you would like to constrain the tool to only generate indexed array
buffer errors in the stack with a magnitude of close and only using integer
types.  Here are the steps you would take to accomplish this:

1. Make a copy of `fett/cwesEvaluation/bufferErrors/bufferErrors.cfr`.  Do not
   directly edit `fett/cwesEvaluation/bufferErrors/bufferErrors.cfr`.
2. Add the following lines to the bottom of your error model:
```
  [BufferIndexScheme_IndexArray]
  [Location_Stack]
  [Magnitude_Close]
```
  The final file will look like:
```
// Model of BufferError vulnerabilities
// and concrete tests

// End of BufferErrors
```
3. Make the following changes to the `bufferErrors` section of `config.ini`:
  * Set `useCustomErrorModel` to `Yes`
  * Set `pathToCustomErrorModel` to your error model file
  * Set `numericTypes` to `[ints]`
4. Run Fett
