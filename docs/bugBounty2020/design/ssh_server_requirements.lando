requirements OpenSSH server 7.3 configuration 

Open_ssh_dependencies
OpenSSH has dependencies on zlib and OpenSSL (or another SSL library), 
and optionally libfido2.

zlib is a software library used for data compression.

libfido2 provides library functionality and command-line tools 
to communicate with a FIDO device over USB, and to verify 
attestation and assertion signatures.

Open_sshd_config
OpenSSH server requires an default configured sshd_config file. 

Open_ssh_keygen
The install also provides authentication keys by 
standard mechanism ssh-keygen.

Open_sshd_check_config
The sshd_config file specifies the locations of one or more 
host key files (mandatory) and the location of authorized_keys 
files for users. The config should be checked with the following 
command: sshd -t -f /path/to/sshd_config.

Open_sshd_access_service
Create a user-password pair per researcher (team) for logging purpose. 
No additional authentication mechanism is required because each 
researcher will have their own target.
