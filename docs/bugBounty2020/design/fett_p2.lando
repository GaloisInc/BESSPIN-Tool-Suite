subsystem FETT P2
The P2 Target System Software.

component P2 Target CVEs
The CVEs exposed by the FETT P2 system.

component P2 Target Forensics
Target state that can be inspected by the FETT Runner. In this case, this should
include OS core dumps, application core dumps, system logs, application logs,
and processor state.

// Target Application Components
component P2 Target Applications
The supported applications on the P2 Target System.

component SSH Server
The SSH service application.

// @note abakst Some of the constraints below are derived
// from the FETT-Voting requirements

// @note abakst this serves as a very high level set of requirements
// and descriptions. A separate file will document the requirements
// for the concrete instantiation of the web server
// (e.g. resources, configuration, etc.)
component Web Server
The Web Server application.

  Web Server must support SSL/TLS.  
  Web Server must support execution of external programs (via CGI or similar mechanism).  
  Web Server and external program execution mechanism must support submission of forms
    including attached files.
  Web Server must log all connections and connection attempts.
  Web Server must support execution of external programs (via CGI or similar mechanism).  
  Execute HTTP Method!
  Execute HTTPS Method!

component DatabaseCLI
The Database CLI application.

  Create new database!
  Execute SQL statement!

component Base OS Image
The Base OS image that hosts the Target applications.

  Each P2 Target Application must be supported on the Base OS Image.

  Which services are running?
  Start a service from the P2 Target Applications list! // Note that for SQLite, this is a noop
  Stop a service from the P2 Target Applications list!  // Note that for SQLite, this is a noop

requirements Target System

// This requirement should serve as the high level specification
// for the concrete instantiation of each component, i.e. if we instantiate
// the web server with NGINX, then we must define an exposed CVE list
// and the features required such that each CVE is present.

Base CVEs Exposed
For each CVE in the P2 Target CVE list, there is a member of P2 Target
Applications that is configured according to the publicly available CVE details
to contain the vulnerability.
