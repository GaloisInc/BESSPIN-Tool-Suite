relation CyberPhys contains ECU

subsystem ECU
    Subsystem containing a state machine responsible for the control of various electronic vehicle subsystems.

relation ECU contains Secure ECU
relation ECU contains Baseline ECU

component ECU SW
    The transmission shifter gear must be park, reverse, neutral, or drive.
    What is the transmission shifter gear?
    What is the brake pedal position?
    What is the throttle pedal position?
    Send Heartbeat ACK!
    ECU SW periodically sends brake/throttle/gear position to Security Mux.

component Secure ECU
    Instance of ECU SW running on secure hardware.

relation Secure ECU inherit ECU SW

component Baseline ECU
    Instance of ECU SW running on baseline hardware.

relation Baseline ECU inherit ECU SW

relation CyberPhys contains Infotainment

subsystem Infotainment
    Provides vehicle information and entertainment.

relation Infotainment contains Secure Infotainment Server
relation Infotainment contains Baseline Infotainment Server
relation Infotainment contains Infotainment Thin Client

component Infotainment Thin Client
    What is selected feature?
    Selected feature is Vehicle Position or Vehicle Info.
    What is Vehicle Info?
    What is Vehicle Position?
    Thin Client asks Infotainment Server for data to display.
    Send Heartbeat ACK!

component Infotainment Server SW
    Respond to data query!
    A response contains vehicle information, music selection state, and map position data.
    Send Heartbeat ACK!

component Secure Infotainment Server
    Instance of Infotainment Server SW running on secure hardware.

relation Secure Infotainment Server inherit Infotainment Server SW

relation CyberPhys contains Simulator PC

subsystem Simulator PC
    Windows Desktop PC with a powerful graphics card.
    Runs Ignition, BeamNG and Security Mux.
    Interacts with the speedometer and the steering wheel subsystems.
    Displays the simulation output on the Display subsystem.

relation Simulator PC contains BeamNG
relation Simulator PC contains Ignition
relation Simulator PC contains Security Mux
relation Simulator PC contains Instrument Cluster
relation Simulator PC contains SimPCDisplay

// Controls BeamNG simulation
component Ignition
    Start simulation!
    Stop simulation!
    Restart simulation!
    Is steering wheel assembly connected?
    Are you receiving data from the pedals?
    Are you receiving transmission shifter data?
    Turn the wheel given a strength and direction!
    Strength is a float between 0 and 1.
    Direction is clockwise or counterclockwise.
    What is the state of BeamNG?
    BeamNG state is either Stopped or Running.
    Is a component alive?
    The component to query is: Security Mux, Instrument Cluster
    Display a message on SimPCDisplay.

component BeamNG
    This component is the actual BeamNG.drive car simulator.
    This component is controlled by Ignition.

component SimPCDisplay
    Display video from BeamNG!

component Security Mux
    What is the current security mode?
    Relay ECU data to Ignition based on the security mode!
    Relay Infotainment response to Infotainment Thin Client based on the security mode!
    The security mode is Secure ECU, Secure Infotainment, or Baseline.
    Select Secure ECU, Secure Infotainment, or Baseline mode.

component Instrument Cluster
    Vehicle speed must be non-negative.
    Display vehicle speed!

relation CyberPhys contains Admin PC

subsystem Admin PC
    A Linux desktop PC that ensures the CyberPhys system is alive and operational. 
    Runs BESSPIN-target and uses SSH connections and watchdogs to monitor other subsystems.

relation Admin PC contains BESSPIN Tool

component BESSPIN Tool
    Provision component!
    Is a provisioned component alive?
    FreeRTOS component that can be provisioned is: Baseline ECU 1, Baseline ECU 2, Secure ECU.
    Linux/BSD component that can be provisioned is: Baseline Infotainment Server 1, Baseline Infotainment Server 2, Secure Infotainment Server.
    Is a non-provisioned component alive?
    The non-provisioned components are: Infotainment Thin Client, Hacker UI, Ignition, BeamNG.
    BESSPIN tool implements a watchdog for each component.
    BESSPIN tool monitors components for errors.
    If monitored components become unresponsive, they are reprovisioned if possible.
    BESSPIN tools logs message and errors in a system log.
    Ask Ignition to display a message!
    BESSPIN tools can display error/system messages on SimPCDisplay.
